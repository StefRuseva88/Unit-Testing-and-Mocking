# Unit-Testing-and-Mocking
## This is a test project for SoftUni QA Back-End Test technologies - January/2024 @ course.

### Project Description
This repository contains a series of test projects aimed at demonstrating key concepts and techniques in back-end test automation. The focus is on unit testing, decoupling, and mocking using the Moq framework in C#. This project is part of the SoftUni QA Back-End Test Technologies course, designed to equip students with the necessary skills to effectively test back-end systems.

### Key Concepts
- Unit Testing: Writing tests to verify the smallest units of code independently.
- Decoupling: Reducing dependencies between components to make the system more modular and testable.
- Mocking: Using the Moq framework to simulate objects and behaviors for testing purposes.
### Technologies Used
- C#: The primary programming language used for the test projects.
- Moq: A popular mocking framework for .NET.
- NUnit: A unit-testing framework for all .NET languages.
### GetGreeting Project
- GetGreeting.Tests: Contains the unit tests for the GetGreeting project.
- GetGreeting: The main project for the GetGreeting application.
### ItemManagement Project
- ItemManagementApp: Contains the application logic for managing items.
- ItemManagementLib: A library containing core functionalities for item management.
- ItemManagementTests: Contains unit tests for the ItemManagement project.
### Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 SDK or higher
- Visual Studio 2022 or later / Visual Studio Code
